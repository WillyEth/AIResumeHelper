# AI Resume Helper Chat Bot

This project, coded by William Kroll, is an AI-powered chat bot designed to assist users with resume-related queries. The application is built using Python and leverages several advanced AI frameworks and libraries.

## Key Features

### Frameworks and Libraries
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for the development of the application.
- **LangChain**: A framework for developing applications powered by language models, enabling the integration of various language model capabilities.
- **LangSmith**: A library for managing and optimizing language model workflows, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the AI processes.
- **Pinecone (VectorDB)**: A vector database used for storing and retrieving high-dimensional vectors, essential for handling embeddings generated by language models.

### User Interface
- **Streamlit**: Provides a simple and interactive interface for users to input their queries, making the application accessible and user-friendly.

### Chat Functionality
- **streamlit_chat**: Powers the chat interface, ensuring a seamless conversation flow between the user and the AI.

### AI Integration
- **run_llm function (backend.core module)**: Handles the backend AI logic, processing user queries and generating appropriate responses.

## Implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

### What is RAG?
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances the capabilities of language models by combining retrieval mechanisms with generation. Instead of relying solely on a pre-trained language model to generate responses, RAG involves retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base and using it to inform the generation process. This approach ensures that the responses are both accurate and contextually relevant, particularly for domain-specific applications like resume assistance.

### How This Code Implements RAG

#### 1. Query Processing
When a user inputs a query through the Streamlit interface, it is first captured and processed by the application. The `streamlit_chat` library facilitates this interaction, providing a seamless and intuitive way for users to engage with the chat bot.

#### 2. Information Retrieval
The processed query is then passed to the backend, where the `run_llm` function from the `backend.core` module takes over. This function utilizes the LangChain and LangSmith frameworks to interpret the query and determine the relevant information needed to respond appropriately.

- **Pinecone Integration**: The `run_llm` function leverages Pinecone to access a vector database containing high-dimensional vectors representing various pieces of resume-related information. These vectors are generated from a pre-defined knowledge base and are essential for accurately retrieving contextually relevant information based on the user's query.

#### 3. Response Generation
Once the relevant information is retrieved from Pinecone, it is combined with the generative capabilities of the language model. The RAG approach ensures that the retrieved data is used to augment the language model's responses, making them more accurate and tailored to the user's specific needs.

- **LangChain and LangSmith**: These frameworks manage and optimize the workflow, ensuring that the integration of retrieval and generation processes is seamless and efficient.

#### 4. Delivering the Response
The final, augmented response is then returned to the user via the chat interface. The use of the `streamlit_chat` library ensures that this process is smooth and that the user experiences a natural and helpful conversation flow.

By implementing RAG, the AI Resume Helper Chat Bot combines the strengths of information retrieval and generative AI, resulting in responses that are both highly relevant and informative. This approach significantly enhances the quality of assistance provided to users, making the chat bot an effective tool for resume-related queries.
